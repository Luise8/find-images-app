# Find Images Application

### A react application to brings up images from Pixabay API in a beautiful grid format. An infinite scroll is included as well as masonry. 
>Previously it was made with Pexels API, but this blocked its use for this type of App. For this reason it was updated to Pixabay API. If you want to check the implementation with Pexels API you can find it in a branch called pexelsBranch.
